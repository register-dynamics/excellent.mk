ifndef EXCELLENT
# excellent.mk â€“ an excellent way of recursing makefiles non-recursively
#
# Usage: include excellent.mk and then request `include.mk` from subdirectories
# e.g.
# 	include excellent.mk
# 	include subdir/include.mk
# `subdir/Makefile` will be included and its targets made available
# with relative names. Variables will also be namespaced.
#
# Defines a named target `clean_include` just for deleting include.mks.
#
# Rules:
# 1. Strictly downwards including only. Don't include ../sibling/include.mk.
# 2. Don't add steps to common named targets (e.g. all), only prerequisites.
# 3. Clean includes before running make in subdirectories
# 	(e.g. running `make` then `make -C subdir` won't work)
